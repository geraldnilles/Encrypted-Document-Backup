Encrypted Document Backup
=========================

# Goal
Create an encrypted database for all of my documents.

The user will be able to upload or scan in an image of PDF.  From there, this program will use Google's OCR (optical character recognition) to convert the document to text.  Finally, the text and document will be encrypted and stored in a database

# Database
I will use a Berkeley Database (BDB) to store the data.  BDB is a key-value database.  Each document will be given a unique, randomly-generated number assigned to it.  

There weill be 2 records entered for each document. The first record will be the actual document.  The key for the document will be the unique number.  The value will be the encrypted document.  The second record will contain the text info for the document.  The key will be "text" and the unique number concatinated, so every text record key will start with "text".  The value will contain the encrypted text.  The text will be a JSON string with the following format: 
	{
		name="Text Provied by the User",
		ocr="Text Generated by OCR"
	}  

## BDB Format

1234=[Encrypted Document 1]
5678=[Encrypted Document 2]
text1234=[Encrypted Text 1]
text5678=[Encrypted Text 2]
